# Car Acceptability Classification
This is the coursework for UCL MSc CEGE0004 Machine Learning for Data Science.

The data used in this project were from a car evaluation [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation) derived from a hierarchical model originally developed for M. Bohanec and V. Rajkovic's research on multi-attribute decision-making in 1990.

Various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Learning, Neural Networks and Model Ensembles were used for Car Acceptability Classification.
